## Features

### Webhook Endpoint

Provides a webhook endpoint that can generate a notification toast.

This feature is useful with the x-pack alerting.

* See [API](#api) for usage.

### Notification History

You can see notification history in the notification center.(It's appear when you click the navbar button.)

This feature is useful when there are notifications that not be checked, such as when you are not looking at the screen.

In particular, you can check notifications received via [webhook](#webhook-endpoint) when you are not connected.

Of course, you can clear the checked notification.

> **NOTE: Not only notifications pushed through api, all notifications of generated by kibana's `Notifier` are displayed in notification center panel.**
